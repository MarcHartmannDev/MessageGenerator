# MessageGenerator

In this Testproject I will create a simple JavaScript program that creates random messages.  
This message will then be printed to the console via `console.log()`

Main topic for the generated messages will be absolutely random since this project is just a simple testproject to get to know Git and Github features.

## Reqiurements

[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en)

## How to run the program?

First of all please make sure Node.js is installed on your PC.  
Please check [Requirements](#reqiurements)

If you want to you can add your own messages to the _`messages`_ Array in the _`main.js`_ file to get some more variation!

After that simply navigate to the project folder and copy the following command into your command line:

    node main.js

## Future Plans

Maybe I will add some more logic in the future that this progam might be able to create own sentences out of a set of given words, but this will just happen if I am bored enough (which most likely won't happen)
