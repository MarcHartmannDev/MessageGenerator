# MessageGenerator

In this testproject I will create a simple JavaScript program that creates random messages.  
This message will then be printed to the console via `console.log()`

Main topic for the generated messages will be absolutely random since this project is just a simple testproject to get to know Git and Github features.

## How to run the program?

simply copy the following command into your command line:

    node main.js
